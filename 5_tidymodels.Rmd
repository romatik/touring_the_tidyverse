# tidymodels

tidymodels is a "meta-package" for modeling and statistical analysis that share the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse.

1. `broom` takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm, nls, or t.test, and turns them into tidy data frames.
1. `infer` is a modern approach to statistical inference.
1. `recipes` is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other help tools.
1. `rsample` has infrastructure for resampling data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated.
1. `yardstick` contains tools for evaluating models (e.g. accuracy, RMSE, etc.)
1. `tidypredict` translates some model prediction equations to SQL for high-performance computing.
1. `tidyposterior` can be used to compare models using resampling and Bayesian analysis.
1. `tidytext` contains tidy tools for quantitative text analysis, including basic text summarization, sentiment analysis, and text modeling.
1. `dials` contains tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters and is designed to integrate well with the parsnip package.

# Current state

1. Current version - `r packageVersion("tidymodels")`.
1. https://github.com/r-lib/tidymodels
1. Developed by __Max Kuhn__, Hadley Wickham.
1. Very early stage.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(package = c("broom", "infer", "recipes", "rsample", "yardstick", "tidypredict", "tidyposterior", "tidytext", "parsnip", "dials")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(version = purrr::map_chr(package, ~as.character(packageVersion(.x))))
```

# Extended demo

We will have a (very) condensed walkthrough of 2-day workshop "Applied Machine Learning" by Max Kuhn that he had during `rstudio::conf(2019L)`.

This should give you an idea about what `tidymodels` is planning to be and what is possible already now.

This is **NOT** a Machine Learning tutorial!
