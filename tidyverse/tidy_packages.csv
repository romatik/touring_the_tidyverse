anomalize,"
    The 'anomalize' package enables a ""tidy"" workflow for detecting anomalies in data.
    The main functions are time_decompose(), anomalize(), and time_recompose().
    When combined, it's quite simple to decompose time series, detect anomalies,
    and create bands separating the ""normal"" data from the anomalous data at scale (i.e. for multiple time series). 
    Time series decomposition is used to remove trend and seasonal components via the time_decompose() function
    and methods include seasonal decomposition of time series by Loess (""stl"") and 
    seasonal decomposition by piecewise medians (""twitter""). The anomalize() function implements
    two methods for anomaly detection of residuals including using an inner quartile range (""iqr"")
    and generalized extreme studentized deviation (""gesd""). These methods are based on
    those used in the 'forecast' package and the Twitter 'AnomalyDetection' package. 
    Refer to the associated functions for specific references for these methods. ",anomaly detection,

epubr,"Provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. 
    The 'epubr' package provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. 
    E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame. 
    E-book formatting is not completely standardized across all literature. 
    It can be challenging to curate parsed e-book content across an arbitrary collection of e-books 
    perfectly and in completely general form, to yield a singular, consistently formatted output. 
    Many EPUB files do not even contain all the same pieces of information in their respective metadata. 
    EPUB file parsing functionality in this package is intended for relatively general application to arbitrary EPUB e-books. 
    However, poorly formatted e-books or e-books with highly uncommon formatting may not work with this package. 
    There may even be cases where an EPUB file has DRM or some other property that makes it impossible to read with 'epubr'. 
    Text is read 'as is' for the most part. The only nominal changes are minor substitutions, for example curly quotes changed to straight quotes. 
    Substantive changes are expected to be performed subsequently by the user as part of their text analysis.

tidyposterior,"Bayesian analysis used here to answer the question: ""when looking at resampling results, are the differences between models 'real'?"" To answer this, a model can be created were the performance statistic is the resampling statistics (e.g. accuracy or RMSE). These values are explained by the model types. In doing this, we can get parameter estimates for each model's affect on performance and make statistical (and practical) comparisons between models. The methods included here are similar to Benavoli et al (2017) <http://jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-305.html>.",Bayesian statistics,
